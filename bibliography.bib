  abstract = {The integration of technology in everyday activities is rising, with objects being increasingly equipped with computational capabilities and interconnected to form the Internet of Things, leading to the need for innovative cyber-physical services capable of creating a fast bridge between the real and virtual world.
              
              The central idea of this thesis focuses on leveraging Kotlin Multiplatform to enhance aggregate computing based on XC principles, addressing challenges in developing versatile solutions across different environments, with the need of efficient and scalable applications operating from cloud to edge to mesh networks.
              
              This thesis combines theoretical analysis, software development, and performance evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the objective, demonstrating versatility and efficiency.
              There is a notable improvement in performance, scalability, and adaptability across different network environments.
              With the proposed approach, the developed solution appears to be more efficient and effective in addressing complex challenges within systems rather than the current state of the art.
              The results demonstrate the transformative potential of this technology, suggesting that it can lead to more efficient and versatile service development.
              
              In summary, this thesis shows the feasibility of using Kotlin Multiplatform to implement aggregate computing based on XC, demonstrating that the proposed approach is more efficient and scalable than the state of the art.
              Improved performance and scalability are emphasised through this approach, which opens doors for more efficient and
              adaptable solutions.
              This study sets the stage for future developments that could improve service efficiency and effectiveness.}

Recently, aggregate computing has emerged as a prominent paradigm for so-called collective adaptive systems programming. To shorten the gap between such research endeavours and mainstream software development and engineering, we present ScaFi, a Scala toolkit providing an internal domain-specific language, libraries, a simulation environment, and runtime support for practical aggregate computing systems development.}

  abstract  = {Many interesting systems in several disciplines can be modeled as networks of nodes that can store and exchange data: pervasive systems, edge computing scenarios, and even biological and bio-inspired systems. These systems feature inherent complexity, and often simulation is the preferred (and sometimes the only) way of investigating their behavior; this is true both in the design phase and in the verification and testing phase. In this tutorial paper, we provide a guide to the simulation of such systems by leveraging Alchemist, an existing research tool used in several works in the literature. We introduce its meta-model and its extensible architecture; we discuss reference examples of increasing complexity; and we finally show how to configure the tool to automatically execute multiple repetitions of simulations with different controlled variables, achieving reliable and reproducible results.},

  abstract  = {The notion of a computational field has been proposed as a unifying abstraction for developing distributed systems, focusing on the computations and coordination of aggregates of devices instead of individual behavior. Prior field-based languages, however, have suffered from a number of practical limitations that have posed barriers to adoption and use. We address these limitations by introduction of Protelis, a functional language based on computational fields and embedded in Java, thereby enabling the construction of widely reusable components of aggregate systems. We demonstrate the simplicity of Protelis integration and programming through two examples: simulation of a pervasive computing scenario in the Alchemist simulator [24], and coordinated management of a network of services.},
