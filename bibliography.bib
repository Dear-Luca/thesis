  abstract = {The integration of technology in everyday activities is rising, with objects being increasingly equipped with computational capabilities and interconnected to form the Internet of Things, leading to the need for innovative cyber-physical services capable of creating a fast bridge between the real and virtual world.
              
              The central idea of this thesis focuses on leveraging Kotlin Multiplatform to enhance aggregate computing based on XC principles, addressing challenges in developing versatile solutions across different environments, with the need of efficient and scalable applications operating from cloud to edge to mesh networks.
              
              This thesis combines theoretical analysis, software development, and performance evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the objective, demonstrating versatility and efficiency.
              There is a notable improvement in performance, scalability, and adaptability across different network environments.
              With the proposed approach, the developed solution appears to be more efficient and effective in addressing complex challenges within systems rather than the current state of the art.
              The results demonstrate the transformative potential of this technology, suggesting that it can lead to more efficient and versatile service development.
              
              In summary, this thesis shows the feasibility of using Kotlin Multiplatform to implement aggregate computing based on XC, demonstrating that the proposed approach is more efficient and scalable than the state of the art.
              Improved performance and scalability are emphasised through this approach, which opens doors for more efficient and
              adaptable solutions.
              This study sets the stage for future developments that could improve service efficiency and effectiveness.}

Recently, aggregate computing has emerged as a prominent paradigm for so-called collective adaptive systems programming. To shorten the gap between such research endeavours and mainstream software development and engineering, we present ScaFi, a Scala toolkit providing an internal domain-specific language, libraries, a simulation environment, and runtime support for practical aggregate computing systems development.}

Prior field-based languages, however, have suffered from a number of practical limitations that have posed barriers to adoption and use. We address these limitations by introduction of Protelis, a functional language based on computational fields and embedded in Java, thereby enabling the construction of widely reusable components of aggregate systems. We demonstrate the simplicity of Protelis integration and programming through two examples: simulation of a pervasive computing scenario in the Alchemist simulator [24], and coordinated management of a network of services.},

  abstract = {Distributed collective systems are systems formed by homogeneous dynamic collections of devices acting in a shared environment to pursue a joint task or goal. Typical applications emerge in the context of wireless sensor networks, robot swarms, groups of wearable-augmented people, and computing infrastructures. Programming such systems is notoriously hard, due to requirements of scalability, concurrency, faults, and difficulty in making desired collective behaviour ultimately emerge: ad-hoc languages and mechanisms have been proposed threads like spatial computing, macro-programming, and field-based coordination. In this paper we present the eXchange Calculus (XC), formalising a tiny set of key mechanisms, usable across many different languages and platforms, allowing to express the overall interactive behaviour of distributed collective systems in a declarative way. In this approach, computation (executed in asynchronous rounds), communication (which is neighbour-based), and state over time, are all expressed by a single declarative construct, called exchange. We provide a formalisation of XC in terms of syntax, device-level and network-level semantics, prove a number of properties of the calculus, and discuss applicability considering a smart city scenario. XC is implemented as a DSL in Scala and in C＋＋, with different trade-offs in terms of productivity and platform targetting.}
